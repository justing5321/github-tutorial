## Git vs. Github
* Git   
 * Version control: Git keeps your lastest bits of code or snapshots to refer back to later  
 * *Note: GIT DOES NOT REQUIRE GITHUB!
* Github
  * space where all your code is saved
  * Saves for work to the "Cloud"
  * Easily lets multiple people work on files
  * *Note: REQUIRES GIT!

## Repository setup
###Creating a repository:  
* Go to your command line on the bottom of the screen and you should make a new repository(Make an appropriate title)  
* To do that you will type mkdir(making your directory), space, (whatever your repo is named) and then press enter.  
* Then you should type cd (whatever your file is called) because you want to be in that file so you can keep all of your work in one place.  
*  Now you should do a one time setup which gets saved in order to know who did this beautiful work.
  * type git `init`
